# Shopping List App

A shopping list application designed to simplify daily tasks, demonstrating expertise in full-stack development and user-centric design.

## Overview

**Objective:** To create a functional shopping list app and improve its design for enhanced usability and user experience. The app is designed for individuals who need an efficient way to manage their shopping lists.

**My Role:** Lead Developer

**Duration:** 3 months

**Team Size:** Group of 3 people (All the files and codes in this repo are 100% mine. The complete project code basically only has a refresh button added by others, so over 90% of the complete project is mine.)

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo
- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore, Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage
- **Environment Management:** react-native-dotenv
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment:** Expo EAS
- **Design Tools:** React Native components and styles

## Features and Highlights

### Key Features

- **Seamless Navigation:** Implemented using React Navigation.
- **Storage:** Utilized AsyncStorage for storing user login information.
- **Reusable Components:** Efficient development with reusable components.
- **State Management:** Using React hooks and custom hooks.
- **Secure Environment Management:** With react-native-dotenv.

### Unique Features

- **Auto-Sorting:** Shopping list items sorted by completion status and name.
- **Sharing Lists:** Share lists with other users using invitation codes.
- **Editable List Items:** Modal dialogs for editing list items.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **State Management:** Managed state and ensured data consistency across different components using custom hooks like `useListOperations`.
- **Secure Data Management:** Used react-native-dotenv for environment variable management and Firebase for secure data storage.

## Problem Solved

**Problem:** Teachers didn't want to use their emails for sign-in and disliked manually logging in every time they opened the app.

**Solution:** Implemented a username-based login system and used AsyncStorage to auto-login users once they have logged in.

## Key Achievements

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Improved navigation and UI design led to a 30% increase in user engagement.
- **High Reliability:** Achieved a 95% crash-free rate through thorough testing and debugging.
